# Choir Master Client

## Overview
This is the client repository for Choir Master, a project started by Covenant College to help choir directors arrange their singers.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). An extensive user guide can be found in the README of its repository, but a summary to get started can be found below.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the git repository.
2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
3. Change into the cloned directory and run `npm install`.

Once the installation is done, you can run some commands inside the project folder:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm test`

Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.  
By default, runs tests related to files changes since the last commit.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
